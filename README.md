Secure Coding Review

This Java code demonstrates several security vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for secure coding practices.
1.Input Validation: Validates user input using the isValidUser method.
2.Descriptive Variable Names: Uses clear and descriptive variable names.
3.Avoid Code Duplication: Extracts common logic into separate methods.
4.Resource Management: Closes resources using a try-with-resources statement.
5.Null Checks: Checks for null before calling methods on an object.

The code includes several private static methods that demonstrate good coding practices:
'isValidUser': a placeholder for actual authentication logic.
'grantAccess and denyAccess': example methods that demonstrate access control.
'multiplyByTwo, calculateSum, and calculateProduct': example methods that demonstrate extracted logic.

This Java code demonstrates secure coding practices, including input validation, descriptive variable names, avoiding 
code duplication, proper resource management, and null checks, providing a solid foundation for secure coding.
